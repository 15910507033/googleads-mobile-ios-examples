========== iOS DFP Banner Example ==========

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google AdMob Ads SDK. You must
add the SDK library and header files into your application. Be sure to also
include the DFP specific headers from the Add-ons/DoubleClick directory of the
download. The SDK files can be downloaded from
https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/.

This project comes with 3 examples:
 1. A Standard 320x50 DFPBannerView example.
 2. A DFPBannerView that supports multiple ad sizes.
 3. A DFPBannerView that supports application events.

You must set the value for the SAMPLE macro in SampleConstants.h to choose
which example you wish to run.
